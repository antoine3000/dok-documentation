Dok ([[about]]) requires Python and some python modules to work. To make our life easier, we also use PIP, the package manager for Python, to manage dependencies. These modules are common and may already be installed on your computer. If not, let's see how to install them.

# Python

Dok is written in [Python 3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)). To verify that Python is already installed on your computer, open a terminal and type :

```
python ––version
```

You are good to go if your Python version is >3.

Otherwise, you will have to install it. Download it from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/), for Linux, Mac OS X or Windows and follow the instructions given by the installer.

# PIP

PIP, the package manager for Python, is also required to run Dok. The Python installer installs pip, so it should be ready for you to use. You can verify that pip is available by running the following command in a terminal: 

```
pip --version
```

It should give you information about the current pip version, if it is correctly installed. If something unusual has happened with PIP, please consult its [official documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/).
